ESPOKESMAN - the espeak web service

RUNNING
  ./server.py

MAKING REQUESTS
  http://localhost:8999/speech?text=hello%20world

DEPENDENCIES
  - lame (mp3 codec tools)
  - espeak (text-to-speech engine)

DESIGN NOTES
  Input (assumed to be a single line) is collected from the http request
  by looking a the 'text' parameter. This input is piped into espeak which
  communicates with lame via a named pipe temporarily created in /tmp (as
  /tmp/espokseman.$PROCESS_ID.wav). The output is delivered to the client
  incrementally as data is produced. The server sends the audio/mpeg content
  type to prime the client to stream audio data, but no content length is set
  because the length is not known ahead of time.
