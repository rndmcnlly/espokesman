ESPOKESMAN - the espeak web service

RUNNING
  twistd -noy espokesman.tac

MAKING REQUESTS
  http://localhost:8999/speech?text=hello%20world

DEPENDENCIES
  - lame (mp3 codec tools)
  - espeak (text-to-speech engine)

DESIGN NOTES
  Input (assumed to be a single line) is collected from the http request
  by looking a the 'text' parameter. This input is piped through espeak to
  produce speech data in the WAV format which is piped through lame to pro-
  duce an mp3 stream which is delivered, incrementally, to the client.
